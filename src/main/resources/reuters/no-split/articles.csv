USBRE9430D220130504,Auto industry love for Mexico grows with new Audi plant,n Klayman,"Sat May 4, 2013 6:54pm EDT",http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/05/04/us-audi-mexico-idUSBRE9430D220130504,"SAN JOSE CHIAPA, Mexico  (Reuters) - The automotive industry's growing love affair with Mexico was celebrated here on Saturday as Audi executives laid the foundation stone for its first assembly plant in the Americas.   Volkswagen AG's ( VOWG_p.DE ) premium brand is joining a parade of automakers who have announced plans to build cars in a country that is seen as a doorway not only to the rest of North and South America but to the world. Audi officials said the $1.3 billion plant will open in three years and eventually be the German brand's only source globally for its Q5 SUVs after it opens in mid-2016. ""Mexico was chosen very deliberately,"" Audi Chairman Rupert Stadler told more than 500 industry and government officials outside the town of San Jose Chiapa in central Mexico. ""It is situated between North and South America, making it a linchpin between the two regions."" He added that Mexico was an ""ideal export base."" With numerous free trade agreements, a cheap, well-educated labor force, and proximity to the lucrative U.S. auto market, combined with growing demand in South America, automakers have been lining up for two years to set up shop in a country that could eventually overtake Brazil as Latin America's biggest economy. Audi's ceremony came two days after Japanese automaker Honda Motor Co ( 7267.T ) said it would build a $470 million transmission plant in the central state of Guanajuato, near an $800 million assembly plant that is expected to begin operations in February 2014. Other automakers who have announced plans to open plants in Mexico include Mazda Motor Co ( 7261.T ) and Nissan Motor Co( 7201.T ), while companies already there - General Motors Co ( GM.N ) and Ford Motor Co ( F.N ) - continue to pump hundreds of millions into their plants. The new plants also are attracting supplier factories and more could be on the way as Nissan's Infiniti brand, BMW ( BMWG.DE ) and Hyundai ( 005380.KS ) are weighing the possibility of building plants in North America. When Nissan said in January 2012 that it would build a $2 billion plant in the central state of Aguascalientes to open in late 2013, CEO Carlos Ghosn called Mexico, where it has now two plants and is the market leader in sales, production and exports, a ""key engine"" to Nissan's growth in the Americas. The Japanese automaker exports to 115 countries from Mexico. Last year, Mexico attracted $3.7 billion in announced investments by automakers alone, matching the U.S. total, according to the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Michigan. IHS Automotive estimated that investments by automakers in Mexico over the next few years could total $3 billion annually. From 2000 to 2013, vehicle production in Mexico has risen almost 3 percent annually, compared with declines in the United States and Canada of 1.3 percent and 2.4 percent, respectively, according to Boston Consulting Group. That trend will hold through 2018 as Mexico's production is forecast to grow 5 percent annually, compared with 3 percent growth in the United States and a 4 percent decline in Canada. Mexico is the eighth largest producer of vehicles in the world. Audi executives touted Mexico's good infrastructure, competitive cost structures and existing free-trade agreements in picking the site for the new plant, which will cover an area the size of 400 soccer fields. They called the Mexian plant a ""dream moment."" VW has a VW plant in nearby Puebla City and an engine plant in Silao. VW has said it wants to boost sales in the United States, the world's No. 2 auto market, to 1 million vehicles by 2018, including 200,000 from Audi. It is the same time frame in which VW has pledged to become the world's largest automaker. Last year, VW's U.S. sales totaled more than 577,000, including 139,310 for Audi. The new plant in Mexico is also part of the automaker's plan for Audi to reach annual global sales of more than 2 million by 2020 with the aim of snatching the luxury crown from BMW globally as well as challenging its luxury rival and Daimler's ( DAIGn.DE ) Mercedes-Benz in the U.S. market. BMW and Mercedes have had production footprints in North America since the 1990s and each sell about twice as many cars in the United States as Audi. Access to the lucrative U.S. market isn't the only draw though as Mexico has 12 free trade agreements with 44 countries, while the United States' 14 trade deals cover only 20 countries. Xavier Mosquet, leader of Boston Consulting Group's automotive practice, said Mexico was the ""better choice"" over the United States for exporting to the rest of Latin America. Also in Mexico's favor are the rising labor costs in China, lower transportation costs and even Mexico's own growing economy, industry officials and analysts said. In 2010, Mexico's total compensation per worker was $3.94 an hour, said Kristin Dziczek, director of labor and industry at the Center for Automotive Research, citing Bureau of Labor Statistics data. That compared with $3.45 in China, $34.59 in the United States and $52.60 in Germany. And the Mexican work force is increasingly well educated. Audi officials say 2,500 applicants, many with degrees, have expressed interest in the 3,800 jobs they will have at the San Jose Chiapa plant and they haven't even advertised the jobs yet. Nomura said last August that Mexico could overtake Brazil as Latin America's top economy as early as 2022. Mexico's annual economic growth is projected to increase 4.5 percent in that period, up from 2.1 percent annual growth from 2002 to 2010. Mexico also serves as a natural hedge for many foreign automakers against stronger currencies at home or disasters like the tsunami in 2011 that hurt the Japanese automakers, IHS analyst Guido Vildozo said. ""It's probably one of the reasons why you're hearing that some of the other automakers are also kicking the tires,"" he said. (Reporting by Ben Klayman in Puebla, Mexico; editing by Gunna Dickson)"
USBRE9430B420130504,Warren Buffett says son Howard qualified to be nonexecutive chairman,,"Sat May 4, 2013 4:00pm EDT",http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/05/04/us-berkshire-agm-chairman-idUSBRE9430B420130504,"OMAHA, Nebraska  (Reuters) - Warren Buffett's son, Howard, will take over as Berkshire Hathaway Inc's nonexecutive chairman someday in order to ensure that Berkshire has the right chief executive in place, the elder Buffett said on Saturday.   Warren Buffett has said in the past that Howard would assume that role when his father was no longer running Berkshire. The ""Oracle of Omaha"" said Saturday that Howard would take that role primarily ""in case a mistake is made"" in picking a CEO.

USBRE94307H20130504,Buffett maps out hopes for Berkshire without him,athan Stempel and  Jennifer Ablan,"Sat May 4, 2013 6:34pm EDT",http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/05/04/us-berkshire-agm-idUSBRE94307H20130504,"OMAHA, Nebraska  (Reuters) - Warren Buffett on Saturday gave the most extensive comments to date about the future of Berkshire Hathaway Inc after he is gone, saying he still expects the conglomerate to be a partner of choice for distressed companies.   Buffett, 82, also defended his plan to install his son, Howard, who has little investing experience, as nonexecutive chairman, saying the younger man's role would be to ensure that Berkshire had the right CEO in place. During the financial crisis and its immediate aftermath, Berkshire helped prop up a number of companies, among them blue-chips such as General Electric and Goldman Sachs. Buffett's investments were viewed by many shareholders as a seal of approval from one of the world's most respected businessmen. Short-seller Doug Kass, invited by Buffett to Berkshire's annual meeting on Saturday to offer contrarian points of view, asked whether a successor would have the same heft. Buffett said it would not matter. ""Berkshire is the 800 number when there is really some panic in the markets, and people really need significant capital,"" Buffett said. ""If you come to a day when the Dow has fallen 1,000 points a day for a few days and the tide has gone out and you find some naked swimmers, those naked swimmers ... will call Berkshire,"" he added. Whoever ultimately takes over Berkshire will run a conglomerate that employs more than 280,000 people in dozens of businesses worldwide, covering everything from ice cream to insurance and retail to railroads. Kass later asked what qualified Howard Buffett, a 58-year-old farmer and philanthropist, to step in as Berkshire's non-executive chairman when his father is gone. The elder Buffett insisted his son was ideal for the task at hand. ""He has no illusions at all of running the business. He won't get paid for running the business,"" Warren Buffett said. ""He'll only have to think about whether the board ... needs to change the CEO."" As in the past, Buffett talked about his successor as CEO without actually identifying him. Speculation usually focuses on a small group of top Berkshire executives, among them insurance boss Ajit Jain and railroad leader Matt Rose. One long-time Buffett-watcher said the legendary investor seemed to handle the pressure from Kass and others well. ""Buffett hasn't broken much new ground, but he's handled Doug's question well ... and, as always, reinforced the Berkshire culture every chance he's had,"" said Jeff Matthews, founder of hedge fund Ram Partners LP and a Buffett biographer. ECONOMIC INDICATOR Berkshire's breadth means that its performance is seen as a barometer for the broader economy. On Saturday, Buffett said he still stands by the actions taken by the U.S. Federal Reserve to stimulate the economy, even as he cautioned that the program could be ""very inflationary."" ""This is like watching a good movie, and I do not know the end,"" he said. ""We have benefited significantly, and the country has benefited significantly, by what the Fed has done."" Buffett also endorsed the last four years of deficit spending by President Barack Obama's administration, saying it is a problem to get off that program but much less of a problem than if the government had followed a strict austerity program instead. ""We are seeing some recovery in housing prices which has psychological effects,"" he said. ""(By the next annual meeting) I think we will have moved forward ... I don't think there will be a surge of any sort, but I don't think we will stall."" Earlier Saturday, one of Buffett's top lieutenants said things were picking up but could improve further. ""It feels like a 2 percent economy. If we want to see GDP click up to 3.5 percent, 4 percent, you need to see more consumption,"" said Rose, CEO of the railroad Burlington Northern, in an interview. Rose said Burlington Northern was seeing ""across the board"" increases in demand to ship things like concrete, roofing tiles and cars. NO TWITTER, THANK YOU Buffett may be optimistic about the economy, but he is decidedly more cautious about technology. Earlier this week he joined Twitter, taking the handle @WarrenBuffett - but insisted he only knew enough about it to press a button when told to. On Saturday he said he disagreed with the recent guidance from the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission that lets companies release material information on Twitter. Some see that as a threat to Berkshire's press release service, Business Wire. ""The key to disclosure is accuracy and simultaneity ... I do not want it, if I am buying Wells Fargo, to keep hitting up their web page and hoping I'm not 10 seconds behind someone else for some important announcement,"" he said. He also stuck by one of Berkshire's more controversial investments, its recent acquisition of a number of newspapers. The annual meeting crowd applauded when CNBC anchor Andrew Ross Sorkin asked a critical question about the stable of papers. ""It's not going to move the needle in Berkshire ... we are buying the papers at very, very low prices with (regard to) current earnings,"" Buffett said, adding that he expected to meet or beat a 10 percent rate of return, after-tax. Yet as much as investors want to hear about Berkshire's growth potential and the state of the economy, some also attend the meeting just for a good laugh. The meeting opened, as it does every year, with a video montage. This year's included a duet between Buffett and singer Jon Bon Jovi and a take-off on the TV series ""Breaking Bad."" Some of the best comedy, though, usually comes in the verbal sparring between Buffett and Vice Chairman Charlie Munger over the course of the day. The two are close - they shared an oversize box of peanut brittle during the meeting - but Munger's acerbic tongue pops out from time to time. ""I come to see Charlie Munger needle Warren Buffett - only he can,"" said Sherman Silber, a doctor and shareholder. (Writing by  Ben Berkowitz ; editing by  Bob Burgdorfer  and  Matthew Lewis )"

Following are selected comments by Buffett, Vice Chairman Charlie Munger and other Berkshire executives on a broad range of topics: BUFFETT ON HIS SON HOWARD'S QUALIFICATIONS TO BE NONEXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN AFTER THE ELDER BUFFETT IS NO LONGER RUNNING THE FIRM: Buffet says Howard is taking the role ""in case a mistake is made"" in choosing a CEO, the odds of which are ""less than 1 in 100. ""He has no illusions at all of running the business. He won't get paid for running the business. ""He'll only have to think about whether the board ... needs to change the CEO. ... I know of nobody who will feel that responsibility more as to doing that job responsibly as my son Howard."" BUFFETT ON DEFICIT SPENDING: ""The amount of deficit spending in the last four years, the amount of stimulus provided ... I think has been quite appropriate in relation to the threat to the economy that was posed by the greatest panic in my lifetime. ""The question is, how do you get off that."" BUFFETT ON ECONOMIC RECOVERY: ""We are seeing some recovery in housing prices which has psychological effects. ""(By the next annual meeting) I think we will have moved forward ... I don't think there will be a surge of any sort, but I don't think we will stall."" BUFFETT ON HIS FUTURE: ""There's nothing more fun for me than to find something to add to Berkshire. ""I hope it's true 10 years from now."" BUFFETT, ON ASSET BUBBLES: ""I do not worry about the banking system being the cause of the next bubble."" MUNGER, IN RESPONSE TO BUFFETT: ""I am less optimistic about the banking system than you are long-term."" BUFFETT, ON WHY HE WOULD NOT BUY AN AIRLINE: ""It's a labor-intensive, capital-intensive, largely commodity-type business, and it has been, as (Legg Mason's) Bill Miller points out, a death trap for investors since Orville (Wright) took off."" BUFFETT AND MUNGER ON SHORT-SELLING: Buffett: ""Charlie and I are no strangers to short selling. We both failed it."" Munger: ""We don't like trading agony for money."" BUFFETT, ON WHETHER HIS SUCCESSOR'S STAMP OF APPROVAL WILL BE AS VALUABLE AS HIS OWN: ""Berkshire is the 800 number when there is really some panic in the markets, and people really need significant capital. ""If you come to a day when the Dow has fallen 1,000 points a day for a few days and the tide has gone out and you find some naked swimmers, those naked swimmers ... will call Berkshire."" BUFFETT, ON BERKSHIRE'S NEWSPAPER INVESTMENTS: ""We will get a decent rate of return. Our after-tax return, with declining earnings, which I expect, would be at least 10 percent average ... and I think it could be somewhat higher. ""Everything we have seen to date, and we have a number of papers now, indicates we would meet or beat the 10 percent. It's not going to move the needle in Berkshire ... we are buying the papers at very, very low prices with (regard to) current earnings."" BUFFETT, ON U.S. FEDERAL RESERVE ACTIONS TO STIMULATE THE ECONOMY: ""We're in uncharted territory. The Fed's balance sheet is around $3.4 trillion now, and that's a lot of securities. ""Banks' reserve positions are incredible; Wells Fargo has $175 billion sitting at the Fed earning 0.25 percent. There's all this liquidity that has been created, and it hasn't really hit the market because the banks have let it sit there. ""This is like watching a good movie, and I do not know the end. ""We have benefited significantly, and the country has benefited significantly, by what the Fed has done."" BUFFETT, ON INVESTMENT MANAGERS TODD COMBS AND TED WESCHLER: ""I gave them each $1 billion (to manage) on March 31. We thought they deserved the trust we had when we hired them, and we believe that more than ever."" MUNGER, ASKED HOW TO EXPLAIN BERKSHIRE TO A 13-YEAR-OLD IN TWO MINUTES: ""We always tried to stay sane when other people, a lot of them, go crazy. That's a competitive advantage. ""We want to treat subsidiaries the way we would want (to be treated). You try to be a good partner. ""We are leaving behind a field that is very competitive, and we're getting to a place where we are more unusual. This was a very good idea. I wish we had done it on purpose."" BUFFETT, RESPONDING TO SHORT-SELLER DOUG KASS ON WHETHER BERKSHIRE HAS GROWN TOO BIG TO OUTPERFORM THE MARKET: ""There's no question that we cannot do as well as in the past, and size does matter. In terms of the acquisitions we've made in the last five years, we think we've done pretty well. ""You haven't convinced me to sell the stock yet, Doug."" MUNGER, ON THE SAME QUESTION: ""You look at companies that got really big in the world, the record is not very good. We think we'll do a little better than the giants in the past. Maybe we have a better system."" BUFFETT (@WARRENBUFFETT) ON USING TWITTER TO DISCLOSE MATERIAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION: ""The key to disclosure is accuracy and simultaneity ... I do not want it, if I am buying Wells Fargo, to keep hitting up their Web page and hoping I'm not 10 seconds behind someone else for some important announcement."" BUFFETT ON HOW SOCIAL MEDIA HAS IMPACTED BERKSHIRE'S BUSINESSES: ""At a place like Geico it makes a difference and over time it will make a huge difference. We have to listen to our customers. I've been amazed at how the world has changed."" BUFFETT ON GROWING IN COMMERCIAL INSURANCE ""I think you will see Berkshire become a very significant factor in commercial insurance."" He added that the business's size could ultimately be ""a fair number of billions."" BUFFETT ON BERKSHIRE'S NEXT CEO: ""The key is preserving a culture and having a successor, a CEO that will have more brains, more energy, more passion for it than even I have ... We're solidly in agreement as to who that individual should be."" MUNGER ON BERKSHIRE'S RETURNS: ""I don't pay attention to five years, three years in terms of annual gains because our past returns were almost unbelievable. We are slowing down a little bit but still pleasant."" BUFFETT ON BERKSHIRE'S SIZE: ""We are now the fifth-most valuable company in the world."" BURLINGTON NORTHERN CEO MATT ROSE, ON THE ECONOMY: ""It feels like a 2 percent economy. If we want to see GDP click up to 3.5 percent, 4 percent, you need to see more consumption. ""Long-term the question is how the Fed makes the transition from QE to backing out of the market. That's the million-dollar question.""

USBRE9420YT20130504,"Berkshire profit rises 51 percent, shares at record high",athan Stempel and  Jennifer Ablan,"Sat May 4, 2013 3:39am EDT",http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/05/04/us-berkshire-results-idUSBRE9420YT20130504,"OMAHA, Nebraska  (Reuters) - Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc on Friday said quarterly profit rose nearly 51 percent on a solid performance in insurance and by many of its other businesses, as well as gains from investments and derivatives.   The results topped expectations and were released after Berkshire shares closed at a record high. Berkshire's more than 80 businesses are benefiting from a strengthening economy, as illustrated by increased traffic on its Burlington Northern railroad unit, new customers for its McLane food distribution business, and stepped-up demand for its Forest River recreational vehicles, to name just a few. Profit from insurance operations, including the Geico car insurance unit and a business that provides protection against major catastrophes, roughly doubled. ""The happy fact right now is that the growth areas in the economy are right in Berkshire's wheelhouse,"" said Jeff Matthews, founder of the RAM Partners LP hedge fund and author of ""Pilgrimage to Warren Buffett's Omaha."" Berkshire released its results a day before Buffett and Berkshire Vice Chairman Charlie Munger will field five hours of shareholder questions at the company's annual meeting in its hometown of Omaha, Nebraska. PROFIT TOPS FORECASTS Net income increased to $4.89 billion, or $2,977 per Class A share, from $3.25 billion, or $1,966 per share, a year earlier. Quarterly operating profit rose 42 percent to $3.78 billion, or $2,302 per share, from $2.67 billion, or $1,615 per share. Analysts on average expected profit of $1,996 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Book value per share, Buffett's preferred measure of growth, increased 5.5 percent from year end to $120,525 per Class A share, and Berkshire's cash stake grew over that period to $49.09 billion from $46.99 billion. About $12.1 billion is being used to fund a purchase by Berkshire and Brazilian investment firm 3G Capital of ketchup maker H.J. Heinz Co. Revenue rose 15 percent from a year ago to $43.87 billion. INSURANCE GAINS Operating profit from insurance operations rose to $1.7 billion from $845 million. Nearly all the improvement came from underwriting, where profit rose to $901 million from $54 million, in part because of a $255 million pre-tax reinsurance gain, as well as currency fluctuations. Underwriting profit at Geico more than doubled. ""The backbone of Berkshire is its world class collection of insurance companies,"" said David Rolfe, chief investment officer at Wedgewood Partners Inc, which invests 6.5 percent of its $4 billion of assets in Berkshire stock. Operating profit from noninsurance business rose 12 percent to $2.25 billion. This included increases of 14 percent at Burlington Northern to $798 million, and a little over 10 percent from manufacturing, service and retail operations to $944 million. Profit generated by MidAmerican Energy, a utility unit that Berkshire owns most of, rose 17 percent to $394 million. Investment and derivatives gains nearly doubled to $1.11 billion, in part because of gains related to Berkshire's warrants for General Electric Co and Goldman Sachs Group Inc . Berkshire also owns tens of billions of dollars of common stocks such as Coca-Cola Co, International Business Machines Corp and Wells Fargo & Co. Gains from derivatives increased 20 percent before taxes, mainly because of Berkshire's long-term contracts related to performance in stock indexes such as the Standard & Poor's 500, which rose 10 percent in the first quarter. Investors are used to that volatility, and Berkshire accepts it as part of its focus on the long term. ""If we cope well every day with what's on our desk, the future will take care of itself,"" Munger said in an interview on Friday. In Friday trading, Berkshire Class A shares closed up $1,993, or 1.2 percent, at $162,850. Its Class B shares closed up $1.34, or 1.2 percent, at $108.64.

USBRE94301520130504,Credit Suisse says ex-VP stole trade secrets in move to Goldman,ry Baynes,"Fri May 3, 2013 9:01pm EDT",http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/05/04/us-creditsuisse-goldman-idUSBRE94301520130504,"(Reuters) - Credit Suisse Group AG ( CSGN.VX ) sued the former vice president of its emerging markets group on Friday, claiming she stole confidential documents and trade secrets to transfer business to her new employer, Goldman Sachs Group Inc ( GS.N ).   In a complaint filed in Manhattan state court, Credit Suisse said Agostina Pechi sent confidential and highly sensitive company documents to her personal email account in the months leading up to her resignation, including databases, client contact information and sales team targets. The Swiss bank also accused her of conducting an ""after-hours document raid"" when she was scheduled to be on vacation in which she allegedly copied transaction documents related to a longtime Credit Suisse client. After Pechi resigned on April 2 and told the human resources department she was accepting a new position with rival Goldman Sachs, Credit Suisse launched an investigation into her departure and found 60 work emails in her personal account, according to the filing. The next day, those emails had been deleted and could not be recovered, the complaint said. ""Upon information and belief, Pechi intends to use confidential Credit Suisse information to compete with Credit Suisse, and intends to provide this information to her new employer to specifically target Credit Suisse's clients,"" the complaint said. Michael DuVally, a Goldman Sachs spokesman, declined to comment. A lawyer for Pechi could not immediately be located. Credit Suisse is seeking a temporary restraining order, barring Pechi for 30 days from seeking business from the company's clients. In addition, it asked the court to order Pechi to return all confidential Credit Suisse information and trade secrets. Under her employment agreement, Pechi agreed to resolve any employment-related disputes in arbitration. In its court filing, Credit Suisse said it would pursue expedited mediation, and, if that fails, arbitration. But a court order was needed to prevent Credit Suisse from being harmed in the interim, the company said. The case is Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC v.

USBRE94306P20130504,Dubai aims to triple tourism income by 2020,tt Smith,"Sat May 4, 2013 11:34am EDT",http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/05/04/us-dubai-tourism-idUSBRE94306P20130504,"DUBAI  (Reuters) - Dubai aims to triple its annual income from tourism to 300 billion dirhams ($82 billion) by 2020, which would involve doubling the number of its hotel rooms, a senior official said.   Tourism is crucial to Dubai's economy, which had a gross domestic product of around $90 billion last year; it supports the emirate's large retail industry as well as its hospitality sector. Occupancy at Dubai's 599 hotels, which have 80,500 rooms combined, was 78 percent in 2012 as the number of visitors rose 9.3 percent from a year ago to 10.16 million, according to data from the Department of Tourism and Commerce Marketing (DTCM). Helal Almarri, director-general of the DTCM, told Reuters that the emirate was likely to have more than 160,000 hotel rooms by the end of the decade and aimed to attract 20 million tourists annually by then. Most decisions to build hotels would not be made by the Dubai government but by private companies. However, the Dubai government is active in supporting growth of the industry by providing infrastructure, marketing the emirate overseas, adjusting visa policies for visitors and expanding the network of the state-owned Emirates airline. Saudi Arabia, India and Russia will be the main contributors to expected growth in tourist numbers, Almarri told Reuters. ""With Emirates airline and other carriers we focus very much on extending the routes to those markets,"" he said. Dubai's main airport handled 5.85 million passengers in March, up 20.6 percent from a year earlier, according to airport authorities. ""Airport capacity is not on our critical list of issues to worry about,"" said Almarri. ""We can easily put on more flights at any time."" Dubai is pressing ahead with a $7.8 billion plan to expand Dubai International Airport, and plans eventually to migrate traffic to an even bigger facility. MIX OF HOTELS Traditionally, Dubai has been known for five-star hotels, but more budget hotels have been built in the last few years, appealing to a wider tourist base. Almarri acknowledged this was an important trend. ""The importance in our growth is to have a mix of hotels,"" he said. ""Over the last five years the hotel offering in Dubai has become more diversified."" At present, hotel guests stay for an average of 3.76 nights; hotel revenue was $5.13 billion in 2012. Almarri said that to help increase the average length of stay, Dubai would build more entertainment facilities. Plans for several theme parks have been announced in the last few months by companies backed by the government or Dubai's ruling family. ""I have every confidence that we will have over the next three to four years coming on line a significant number of tourist attractions which are purely entertainment-like theme parks,"" said Almarri. Having been forced to provision heavily for bad loans following the collapse of Dubai's real estate market in 2008-2011, banks have become more prudent about financing large-scale projects. Almarri said the theme parks would be funded largely through public-private partnerships. ""Theme parks are procured rather than built in many cases, so come with their own financing packages - the rides are built elsewhere, so you will probably find that many governments around the world are encouraging exports,"" he said.

Orsi was arrested on February 12 on a warrant alleging he paid bribes to win a 560 million euro ($727 million) contract to sell helicopters to India in 2010, when he was at the helm of Finmeccanica's helicopter unit AgustaWestland. Orsi, who resigned from the state-owned aerospace and defense group a few days after his arrest, denies any wrongdoing. He was released from jail because the terms that allowed prosecutors to keep him in custody ahead of a trial had expired. Orsi's trial will begin on June 19 after a judge ruled on Friday that there was enough evidence for a procedure to start immediately, legal sources close to the case told Reuters. In an e-mailed statement, Orsi's lawyer Ennio Amodio said on Saturday that his client had sought to bring order and transparency to a company hit by internal power struggles, and that he was confident truth would prevail at the trial.

Olli Rehn, the European monetary affairs commissioner, said on Friday France badly needed to unlock its growth potential and create jobs, adding Spain, Italy and the Netherlands as well as France - four of the euro zone's five largest economies - would remain in recession this year. France - which restated on Friday it would bring the deficit below 3 percent in 2014, only one year later than the original deadline - must pursue its retirement and labor reforms to boost its competitiveness and to overcome its unemployment crisis, Barnier said. ""It's a moment of truth for the government which needs to have the political courage to carry out those reforms which will sometimes not be understood, and require effort,"" he told French radio Europe 1 in an interview. German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said the EU's decision was in line with the strengthened stability and growth pact because it allowed flexibility in meeting deficit targets. ""But the commission also said, and that's very important, that with (the extension) come clear requirements for necessary reforms,"" he told Bild am Sonntag newspaper to be published on Sunday. ""The commission and the German government agree entirely that we can't slow down in terms of reforms,"" Schaeuble added. EU finance ministers had given France until this year to bring down its budget shortfall below 3 percent of GDP and set the deadline for Spain for 2014. But while France expects its economy to expand by 0.1 percent this year, the European Commission forecast a 0.1 percent contraction. Granting more time is a victory for French President Francois Hollande, who won elections promising a focus on growth and less on austerity but has little to show for his economic policies after a year in office.

USBRE9430AJ20130504,France spurns call to take over Saint-Nazaire shipyard,,"Sat May 4, 2013 3:04pm EDT",http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/05/04/us-france-saint-nazaire-shipyard-idUSBRE9430AJ20130504,"PARIS  (Reuters) - France's government dismissed a call to nationalize the Saint-Nazaire shipyard on Saturday but said it was committed to the survival of the facility after a South Korean shareholder threatened to sell its stake.   The Korean company, STX Offshore & Shipbuilding ( 067250.KS ), has been hurt by a shipping industry downturn since the financial crisis and may also sell shipyards in Finland and China. The French government came to Saint-Nazaire's rescue at the end of 2012, helping it win new contracts to stave off the threat of bankruptcy, including a 1 billion euro ($1.31 billion) contract to build the world's largest cruise liner. It is faring better today but, since STX's announcement on Friday, unions have been calling for the state to nationalize the shipyard on France's Atlantic coast, one of Europe's largest and a symbol of French industrial prestige. The government already holds 33 percent of STX France, the company that owns and operates the Saint-Nazaire site. President Francois Hollande does not want another manufacturing failure on his hands as he struggles a year into his term to make good on a campaign pledge to pull French industry out of the doldrums. In a joint statement, French industry and finance ministers dismissed talk that Saint-Nazaire and the jobs of its 2,000 employees were under threat and said the government would continue to support its development. ""STX France has strengthened its business in the past few months, thanks to winning big contracts, in particular on the export side,"" the ministers said. ""Saint-Nazaire is therefore not threatened at all by the events in South Korea."" Saint-Nazaire will begin building a cruise ship in September for Royal Caribbean Cruise Line, to be delivered in 2016. Industry Minister Arnaud Montebourg told French daily Le Monde that nationalizing the site would serve no purpose. ""The Saint-Nazaire shipyard needs more orders, not a new shareholder, because the site is working well,"" Montebourg said. ""We met the conditions in December 2012 to land an order for a giant liner and we continue to work to ensure the long-term future of the site."" The yard built famous cruise liners such as the Queen Mary 2, commissioned in the early 2000s to sail between Europe and the United States. (Reporting By Muriel Boselli; Editing by  Tom Pfeiffer )"

According to the Journal, the meeting provides a rare opportunity for more junior examiners to talk to Dimon and will be held in the style of a town hall meeting. A spokesman for JPMorgan declined to comment. The meeting comes as JPMorgan faces a host of regulatory woes including potential market manipulation charges and continuing scrutiny by federal investigators over the events leading up to its $6.2 billion trading loss last year. Dimon, meanwhile, is dealing with calls from shareholders to relinquish his role as chairman of the bank's board. Analysts were speculating on Friday the regulator of U.S. power markets was likely to pursue manipulation charges against JPMorgan after the New York Times described a 70-page report by the regulator, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, detailing how the bank transformed ""money-losing power plants into powerful profit centers. The OCC is also expected to issue a cease-and-desist order against the bank for failing to conduct adequate due diligence on Bernard Madoff. According a source familiar with the matter, the order will require JPMorgan to improve its anti-money laundering controls. (Reporting by  Emily Flitter ; Editing by  Lisa Shumaker )"
USBRE94308620130504,JPMorgan shareholders urged to reject three directors,,"Sat May 4, 2013 5:19pm EDT",http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/05/04/us-jpmorgan-directors-idUSBRE94308620130504,"NEW YORK  (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co ( JPM.N ) shareholders should vote against the re-election of three board members because they failed to properly oversee risk-taking that led to $6.2 billion of losses on the so-called ""London Whale"" trades, an influential proxy advisory firm said.   ISS Proxy Advisory Services said in a report released late Friday that directors David Cote, James Crown and Ellen Flutter should not be re-elected at the company's annual meeting this month because of ""material failures of stewardship and risk oversight."" The report by ISS ratchets up pressure on directors to reduce Dimon's power at JPMorgan, the biggest bank based in the United States, as some stockholders push for more supervision of the outspoken executive. A statement from JPMorgan spokeswoman Kristin Lemkau on Saturday said: ""The company strongly endorses the re-election of its current directors and disagrees with ISS's position."" ISS also renewed its recommendation from a year ago that CEO and Chairman of the Board Jamie Dimon give up one of those two titles. ISS said investigations of the derivatives loss, which surfaced right before last year's shareholder meeting, showed that JPMorgan executives need more independent oversight and that the company is too big and too complex for one person to be able to do both jobs. Shareholders will meet on May 21 in Tampa, Florida. They will vote on the re-election of the company's 11 directors and on a non-binding proposal from four institutional shareholders calling on the board to have a chairman who is independent from management. A similar advisory proposal failed to pass last year, receiving only 40 percent of the vote. That vote was five percentage points more than similar proposals at other companies that year. The independent chair vote is developing into a major test for Dimon, 57. It comes as criticism, and sanctions from regulators, over poor risk management have piled up since the ""London Whale"" losses surfaced at the bank, which has $2.39 trillion in assets, the most of any U.S. bank. The trading debacle has picked up the same ""London Whale"" nickname that hedge funds gave to a JPMorgan trader for the outsized derivatives bets he placed for the company. The ISS recommendations on the re-election of directors shows the shareholder debate over governance of the company is broadening beyond Dimon. The three directors who ISS singled out for replacement were members of the board's risk policy committee in December 2010 when the committee was shown a presentation by management that highlighted large profits from trading strategies in the firm's Chief Investment Office, where the derivative losses later occurred. The presentation said the CIO strategies had contributed $2.8 billion of ""economic value"" since inception, with an average annualized return of 100 percent, according to a report released earlier this year by the board on its review of the matter. ISS said the large profits showed that the CIO had changed from a unit that hedged risks to ""what was essentially a proprietary trading desk"" and should have prompted the committee to act against the practice. The company statement added: ""While the company has acknowledged a number of mistakes relating to its losses in CIO, an independent review committee of the board determined that those mistakes were not attributable to the risk committee."" In its proxy statement for the coming meeting, the board said that the actions taken by the company after the ""London Whale"" debacle show it to be strong and independent. After the loss, the board added a member to the risk policy committee - new director Timothy Flynn, a retired chairman of auditor KPMG International. ISS, which researches proxy issues and makes voting recommendations to institutional investors, praised the company for putting Flynn on the panel and recommended that shareholders re-elect him as well as seven other directors. Last year, ISS recommended that all director candidates nominated by the board be elected. The advisory firm said the JPMorgan board needs ""refreshment"" and the panel should search ""for seasoned directors with financial and risk expertise"" to replace Cote, Crown and Futter. Cote is chief executive and board chairman of technology and aerospace company Honeywell International Inc ( HON.N ); Crown is president of investment firm Henry Crown and Co, and Futter is president of the American Museum of Natural History. The company's statement on Saturday also said: ""The members of the board's risk committee have a diversity and breadth of experiences that have served the company well."" ISS said it had discussed the board's independence and the qualifications of the risk policy committee members with the board's presiding director, Lee Raymond, on April 26 before reaching its conclusions. Raymond is a former CEO and chairman of the board of Exxon Mobil Corp. ( XOM.N ) ISS criticized the board for deferring to management and said the panel ""appears to have been largely reactive, making changes only when it was clear that it could no longer maintain the status quo.""

Nonfarm payrolls rose 165,000 last month, the Labor Department said on Friday. March's payrolls were raised to 138,000, 50,000 more jobs than previously reported, and February's job count was revised up to 332,000, the largest since May 2010. Economists polled by Reuters had expected April payrolls to rise 145,000 and the unemployment rate to hold steady at 7.6 percent. The drop in the unemployment rate last month reflected an increase in employment, rather than people leaving the workforce. COMMENTS: ANDREW GRANTHAM, ECONOMIST, CIBC WORLD MARKETS ECONOMICS, TORONTO: ""After a slow build up in terms of a disappointing ADP survey and some of the survey evidence seen over the past week, non-farm payrolls managed a significant upside surprise, not just in terms of the April figure but also upward revisions to previous months. ""Overall, a strong set of numbers which will reassure markets on that the U.S. economy is not as weak as it may have seemed given some of the earlier data, although it may not be strong enough on its own to see renewed talk of tapering QE."" DARRELL CRONK, REGIONAL CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER FOR WELLS FARGO PRIVATE BANK IN NEW YORK: ""That was a strikingly good report, every piece of that. Obviously the number for April was only slightly above consensus but the revisions for March and February were quite frankly stunning, those were really nice revisions. To me the bones of the data are looking really good right now. ""This is the type of data that people then begin to look through some of the noise that is in the ISM data, or the PMI data, some of that type of stuff. When the labor markets are firming up, they feel better about that."" CAM ALBRIGHT, DIRECTOR OF ASSET ALLOCATION, WILMINGTON TRUST INVESTMENT ADVISORS, WILMINGTON, DELAWARE: ""The April numbers were clearly better than expectations, and the fairly large dip we saw in march was largely erased. ""This will probably give the (equity) market at least a near-term boost, particularly given the revisions that we saw."" JAMES BARNES, SENIOR FIXED INCOME PORTFOLIO MANAGER, NATIONAL PENN INVESTORS TRUST CO., WYOMISSING, PENNSYLVANIA: ""These are pretty numbers along with the revisions. The big slowdown people had been expecting might not be as severe as they had thought. The bond market is selling off on this report. This is a type of sell-off that could build momentum throughout the day."" MICHAEL KORN, PRESIDENT AT SKOKIE ENERGY IN PRINCETON, NEW JERSEY: ""The employment number was definitely the trigger for today's rally, so we'll see if right now if U.S. crude can hold the opening of $1 to $1.25 higher. When we get up to about $95, it gets a little shaky. If you're a speculator you may look to sell $2 or $3 higher; if you're a buyer you're probably looking at getting in now. ALAN RUSKIN, HEAD OF G10 FX STRATEGY AT DEUTSCHE BANK IN NEW YORK: ""The payrolls data will definitely go down as substantially stronger than expected, albeit with one weak element: soft hours worked. That will be trumped by substantially stronger payrolls, especially after major prior revisions to February and March data and a decline in the unemployment rate with a decent household employment gain. ""Private payrolls now no longer seem to have had a spring swoon, especially when cold weather is considered (weather was likely a factor behind the -6,000 April construction number. Weather should be a positive factor in the May data."" RUSSELL PRICE, SENIOR ECONOMIST, AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL SERVICES INC, TROY, MICHIGAN: ""As bad as the March number was originally perceived to be, this one's just that much better. It was quite a turnaround. It really does confirm the idea that weather had an impact during the month of March, even though the numbers for March were revised higher. ""And maybe even more importantly, the idea that the employment is holding as well as it is in the face of the fiscal headwinds the economy is currently enduring, is a very positive sign of the economy's underlying fundamental improvements. ""I don't think today's data is strong enough to completely offset some of the weakness we have seen in some other areas, such as overall manufacturing activity and the general pace of economic growth, so I think the Fed will remain fully engaged."" ADDISON ARMSTRONG, DIRECTOR OF MARKET RESEARCH, TRADITION ENERGY IN STAMFORD, CONNECTICUT: ""This report is clearly bullish for commodities. I think that's why crude just popped around 60 cents. The S&P's up and crude's just following that."" JOHN KILDUFF, PARTNER AT AGAIN CAPITAL IN NEW YORK: ""This was a very strong report, it's not necessarily from the headline number, but the upward revisions were quite strong, particularly the February data being revised upwards over 300,000 new jobs. ""Clearly that's lending strength here to the outlook for the U.S. economy and for energy demand, which is quite sensitive to employment outlook and state of employment in general."" OMER ESINER, CHIEF MARKET ANALYST, COMMONWEALTH FOREIGN EXCHANGE, WASHINGTON: ""It was a good number. Certainly better than expected in the headline reading but perhaps more importantly were the very strong upward revisions to the March and February numbers. ""Combined with the decline in the jobless rate the revisions help suggest that the Spring slowdown may not be as pronounced as feared. It is good news for the dollar especially in light of the Fed's statement this week which put even more focus on upcoming U.S. economic numbers."" JOE MANIMBO, MARKET ANALYST, WESTERN UNION BUSINESS SOLUTIONS, WASHINGTON: ""It was surprisingly positive. This shows the job market and the economy in general appear to be more resilient than investors had feared. The weight this jobs report carries from month to month can go some way to reviving the notion that the Fed could taper later this year. And the big revision to February suggests we could even see a revision to first quarter growth."" TOM PORCELLI, CHIEF U.S. ECONOMIST, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS, NEW YORK: ""Looking at the headlines alone it is a positive report, however, taking it all in aggregate it is much more mixed. ""A couple of things drive this home, namely average weekly earnings are down and aggregate hours. Those are more forward looking metrics and how it will unfold in the fourth quarter that is not encouraging."" MARKET REACTION: STOCKS: U.S. stock index futures shot up on Friday after data showed U.S. employment rose more than expected in April, pushing the unemployment rate down to 7.5 percent, which could help ease concerns of a sharp slowdown in the economy. S&P 500 futures SPc1 rose 8.5 points and were above fair value, a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration of the contract. Dow Jones industrial average futures DJc1 added 79 points and Nasdaq 100 futures NDc1 rose 17 points. BONDS: U.S. bond prices fell along with German Bund futures. The benchmark 10-year Treasury note, down 1/32 before the report, was down 19/32 afterwards. Its yield rose to 1.70 percent from 1.63 percent late on Thursday.

USBRE9410LX20130504,Job market resilience eases growth concerns,cia Mutikani,"Sat May 4, 2013 3:39am EDT",http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/05/04/us-usa-economy-jobless-idUSBRE9410LX20130504,"WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Employment rose at a faster pace than expected in April and hiring was much stronger than previously thought in the prior two months, a sign of resilience that should help the economy absorb the blow from belt-tightening in Washington.   Nonfarm payrolls rose by 165,000 jobs last month and the unemployment rate fell to 7.5 percent, the lowest level since December 2008, the Labor Department said on Friday. The job counts for February and March were revised up by a net 114,000. ""This bolsters the case that the U.S. economy will be able to survive the combined headwinds of sequestration and a deepening recession in Europe,"" said Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West in San Francisco. Investors on Wall Street cheered the data, which beat economists' expectations for a 145,000 jobs gain and a steady 7.6 percent reading on the unemployment rate. U.S. stocks rallied, with the Standard & Poor's 500 index and the Dow Jones industrial average closing at record highs. The dollar vaulted to a one-week high against the yen, while Treasury debt prices tumbled. Payrolls rose by 138,000 jobs in March, 50,000 more than previously reported, and job growth for February was revised up by 64,000 to 332,000, the largest increase since May 2010. But the gains last month were far below the 206,000 jobs per month average of the first quarter, the latest evidence the economy is cooling, even if not as quickly as earlier feared. Indeed, the data provided a number of signs of a loss of momentum. Construction employment fell for the first time since May and manufacturing payrolls were flat. The length of the average workweek pulled off a nine-month high and a gauge of the overall work effort fell. Economists pin the slowdown largely on higher taxes that took hold at the start of the year and $85 billion in federal government spending cuts, known as the sequester, that went into effect at the beginning of March. Economies overseas have also weakened, cutting into U.S. export growth. While the U.S. economy grew at a 2.5 percent annual pace in the first quarter, data on construction spending, retail sales and trade suggested it ended the period with less speed. Further, factory data for April imply the economy braked further at the start of the second quarter, a thesis supported by a report on Friday that showed the pace of growth in the services sector in April was the slowest in nine months. ""We are probably going into a second-quarter soft patch, but it's not something that's going to derail the recovery,"" said Julia Coronado, chief North American economist at BNP Paribas in New York. FED STILL IN PLAY The 0.1 percentage point drop in the jobless rate reflected a gain in employment, rather than people leaving the workforce. Indeed, more Americans entered the workforce than in any month since October. The labor force participation rate - the share of working-age Americans who have a job or are looking for one - held steady at a 34-year low of 63.3 percent. While the pace of hiring was stronger than expected in April, it remained below the roughly 300,000 jobs a month that economists say are needed over a sustained period to put a significant dent in unemployment. While the jobless rate has dropped 0.4 percentage point since January, employment is still 2.57 million jobs below where it stood in December 2007. At April's job growth pace, it would take about 16 months to make up that lost ground. About 21.9 million people are either unemployed, working only part-time although wanting full-time work, or want a job but have given up the search. Economists said the data did not appear strong enough to dissuade officials at the Federal Reserve from pressing forward with their bond-buying stimulus, given the immense slack still in the labor market. It did, however, dampen budding speculation the U.S. central bank might step up its purchases. ""It probably cools any expectations that the Fed is going to increase the asset purchases, especially with the unemployment rate declining,"" said Raymond Stone, chief economist at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates in Princeton, New Jersey. A Reuters survey of economists at financial institutions that deal directly with the Fed found 11 of these so-called primary dealers expect the U.S. central bank to continue asset purchases into 2014, while just four saw the program ending this year. GOVERNMENT JOB CUTS WEIGH All the job gains last month were in the private sector, which added 176,000 new positions. Gains were led by a rebound in retail employment, which had dropped in March after eight straight months of increases. Retail payrolls rose 29,300. Temporary help, a harbinger of future hiring, increased by the most since February. It has now risen for seven straight months. ""That tells me payroll growth is going to continue to be on a decent pace,"" said Stone. In a surprise, the construction sector shed 6,000 workers after 10 straight months of gains. Increases in residential construction were offset by declines in jobs for nonresidential builders and other construction workers. Government payrolls dropped 11,000 after falling 16,000 in March. Most of the job losses last month came from the federal government, with big declines at the U.S. Postal Service, which is downsizing. Average hourly earnings rose 0.2 percent. But with average hours worked by private workers slipping to 34.4 hours from 34.6 hours, weekly earnings actually fell. ""The decline in income coupled with a low saving rate does not bode well for consumers,"" said Michelle Meyer, a senior economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in New York.

Investors cheered the jobs report on Friday, which showed employment rose at a faster than anticipated pace an April and hiring in the prior two months was much stronger than previously thought. The report eased investor concerns after a raft of soft data, particularly in the manufacturing sector, and sent the S&P 500 hurtling past what was viewed as its final resistance level of 1,600 to a fresh all-time closing high of 1,614.42. With little in the way of economic data on tap next week and earnings season moving into the home stretch, there appears to be little that could derail a move higher. ""That's the $64,000 question - without a micro or macro focus, what do we shift our attention to?"" said Art Hogan, managing director of Lazard Capital Markets in New York. ""I would argue in a lack of critical information this market has found a path of least resistance to the upside."" The economic calendar for next week is extremely light, with consumer credit and wholesale inventories for March among the few notables. Earnings season continues its wind down, with Walt Disney Co ( DIS.N ) the only Dow component scheduled to report for the week. Its results could also provide a glimpse into the health of consumer spending. Other notable S&P 500 companies expected to post earnings include Tyson Foods Inc ( TSN.N ), Dean Foods Co ( DF.N ), Electronic Arts Inc ( EA.O ), Whole Foods Market ( WFM.O ), Nvidia Corp ( NVDA.O ) and Priceline.com ( PCLN.O ). Corporate earnings have improved from earlier market expectations, with the expected earnings growth now at 5.2 percent, up from 1.5 percent at the start of earnings season. According to Thomson Reuters data through Friday, of the 404 companies in the benchmark 500 index that have reported earnings, 68.3 percent have topped analyst expectations, above the 63 percent average since 1994 and the 67 percent average for the past four quarters. But revenue remains disappointing, with only 46.3 percent of S&P 500 companies topping Wall Street expectations, well below the 62 percent beat rate since 2002 and shy of the 52 percent average for the past four quarters. With the S&P easily breezing past what was seen as its final resistance point of 1,600, the index is now in uncharted waters for investors to try and predict when a pullback may occur or gains may slow. ""(The S&P 500) broke through that 1,600 resistance level like it wasn't even there based on the payrolls report,"" said Paul Mendelsohn, chief investment strategist at Windham Financial Services in Charlotte, Vermont. ""Generally you don't want to fight a 52-week high, you definitely don't want to fight an all-time high."" For the week, the Dow rose 1.8 percent, the S&P 500 gained 2 percent, and the Nasdaq advanced 3 percent. With the gains on Friday, the S&P 500 put together its first consecutive weekly advances since a seven-week run that ended in mid-March, a possible sign of a further move higher. Markets now head into the traditionally weaker summer months. The index has fallen in May for the past three years. ""The key now is, you want to see the bulls continue to push higher, you don't want to see the slip back,"" said Ryan Detrick, senior technical strategist at Schaeffer's Investment Research in Cincinnati, Ohio. ""The ultimate contrarian would say a lot of that very well could be priced in, the thing most people aren't expecting is a continued rally in the normally weak summer months. By the same token, the lofty levels for equities could make them ripe for a pullback, with investors resuming the battle between booking profits and buying dips. That battle caused the index to alternate between weekly gains and losses throughout the latter portion of March and most of April. ""It is a bipolar market.

USBRE94403R20130505,No need for Dailymotion website to be wholly French-owned: minister,,"Sun May 5, 2013 7:35am EDT",http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/05/05/net-us-dailymotion-france-minister-idUSBRE94403R20130505,"PARIS  (Reuters) - There is no need for France Telecom's Dailymotion, an online video-sharing website, to remain wholly French-owned, and all options must be studied, the junior minister for digital economy, Fleur Pellerin, told French media on Sunday.   Last week, Industry Minister Arnaud Montebourg said he had blocked Yahoo Inc's plan to buy a majority stake in Dailymotion because the U.S. group wanted to ""devour"" its smaller competitor, prompting another row over political interference in French companies. ""We don't live in a closed economy. The digital economy is not a Gallic village,"" Pellerin said in an interview in French weekly Journal Du Dimanche. But she said the company, its technology, engineers and jobs must remain anchored in France. Yahoo had been in talks to acquire a 75 percent stake in Dailymotion, owned by France Telecom's Orange, a deal that would have valued Europe's largest video website at $300 million. Pellerin said the deal with Yahoo was not balanced enough and would have led to the disappearance of Dailymotion, but she said it would be an economic and industrial dead-end for Dailymotion to remain exclusively French. ""Our gems are struggling to grow. They need help,"" Pellerin said. ""If this requires a tour with funds from Silicon Valley alongside Orange acting as a reference, this is not a problem for me,"" she said. ""All options need to be studied."" France Telecom's Chief Executive Stephane Richard is preparing a trip to Silicon Valley, the weekly said without naming sources. Entertainment group Vivendi as well as a consortium made up of Iliad founder Xavier Niel, Lazard banker Matthieu Pigasse and industrialist Pierre Berge have made bids to buy the website. Montebourg's blocking of the talks is another blow to France's business image after his verbal attacks last year on firms seeking to shut ailing industrial sites drew international derision.

USBRE94403120130505,"With caution, Japan's neighbors welcome 'Abenomics'",jesh Kumar Singh  and  Tetsushi Kajimoto,"Sun May 5, 2013 5:44am EDT",http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/05/05/us-asia-economy-flows-idUSBRE94403120130505,"GREATER NOIDA, India  (Reuters) - Emerging Asian neighbors are bracing for a surge in capital flows after Japan's unprecedented bid to pump up its long-moribund economy but most believe the upside of cheap cash and a stronger Japanese economy outweighs the risks.   The Bank of Japan stunned global markets last month with its plan to release some $1.4 trillion to end nearly two decades of stagnation and deflation, adding to the wave of quantitative easing stimulus already unleashed by central banks including the U.S. Federal Reserve and the Bank of England. ""We have to be wary of the building up of the asset bubbles. Inflationary pressures are on a bit of an uptick,"" Rajat Nag, Managing Director General of the Asian Development Bank, said during its annual meeting on the outskirts of New Delhi. While others including Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said they would be on the lookout for signs of unintended spillovers on emerging economies, many hope that the benefits of increased Japanese consumption outweigh the risks of asset bubbles, inflation and the competitive impact of a weaker yen. They also said Asia would gain from investment by Japanese companies and in infrastructure that would result from Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's economic program, known as ""Abenomics,"" but stressed the need to monitor capital flows to pre-empt risks to financial and economic stability. Thailand, for example, is worried that its export-oriented economy could be hurt by strength in the baht currency as a result of higher inflows. ""When it was as strong as it was a couple of weeks ago, I have all the reasons to be worried,"" Thai Finance Minister Kittiratt Na-Ranon said of the baht. Kittiratt, however, resists capital controls to manage flows. Instead, he said Thailand could look to lower interest rates -- which the central bank opposes -- and work with neighboring countries to use inflows to help fund projects that depend on imported goods. The Philippines also faces upward pressure on its currency after Standard & Poor's raised its credit rating to investment grade. Japanese institutions, however, account for just 2.8 percent of Philippines stocks and bonds. The Philippines has avoided capital controls and has looked to manage flows by giving easier access to foreign exchange in the banking system and retiring some of its external debt. Central bank Governor Amando Tetangco said ultra-low interest rates in developed economies mean policymakers will have to rely increasingly on non-conventional means and absorb capital flows through investment in the real economy. ""Interest rate policy is no longer sufficient,"" Tetangco said. ""You will have to use other tools."" PREVIOUS CRISIS WEIGHS The 1997 currency crisis that led to economic collapse in several Asian countries means policymakers are sensitive to the risks of volatile fund flows. ""I understand that there are various concerns about effects Japan's monetary policy could cause overseas,"" Japanese Finance Minister Taro Aso said, adding that he had not heard of any such concerns directly from other countries. India, for example, has been able to finance a current account deficit that ballooned to a record 6.7 percent of GDP at the end of December thanks to robust portfolio inflows, making it vulnerable if the quantitative easing spigot is turned off. ""The global liquidity situation could quickly alter for EDEs (emerging and developing economies), including India,"" Reserve Bank of India Governor Duvvuri Subbarao said in his monetary policy statement on Friday in Mumbai. ""With quantitative easing, (advanced economy) central banks are in uncharted territory with considerable uncertainty about the trajectory of recovery and the calibration of QE,"" he said. Paul Sheard, chief global economist at Standard and Poor's, said the Bank of Japan's move is ""long overdue."" ""If Japan comes out of deflation and if the broader agenda of Abenomics is successful, raising the potential growth rate, restoring more animal spirits to the Japanese economy, that's good. It's good for Japan, it's good for the region and it's good for the world."" (Writing by  Tony Munroe ; Editing by  Frank Jack Daniel  and  Sanjeev Miglani )"

""We are studying now some details, but even the government is not really clear when it comes to localization, what type of parts do they mean?"" Rupert Stadler told reporters in Puebla City, Mexico after Audi celebrated the laying of the foundation stone in a nearby town for a $1.3 billion plant that will open in mid-2016. ""The whole framework of laws and regulations is not transparent,"" he added. ""So you cannot now say, 'I'm going to Brazil' because you don't know the details."" Brazil is the world's fourth largest automotive market and many automakers are opening plants there to avoid tariffs on imported vehicles. Audi officials have said in the past the company might add a plant in Brazil. VW officials said in March that they saw the Brazil industry sales slowing this year and the pace of investments in local factories would hinge on demand. Audi rival BMW has said it plans to open a factory in Brazil in late 2014. While Audi has the necessary government approvals to proceed if it wanted, Stadler said he won't invest without more clarity. ""It has to be clear,"" he said. ""What are the conditions? What is the requirement for localization? This is very complicated, so it needs some time."" Stadler also said the opening of the Mexican assembly plant in three years does not close the door on the brand some day building vehicles in the United States.

USBRE94307H20130505,Buffett devotees stick by him even as growth slows,athan Stempel and  Jennifer Ablan,"Sun May 5, 2013 4:04pm EDT",http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/05/05/us-berkshire-agm-idUSBRE94307H20130505,"OMAHA, Nebraska  (Reuters) - Short-seller Douglas Kass, Warren Buffett's handpicked bear, raised a concern on the minds of many shareholders at the ""Woodstock for capitalists"" this weekend: Has Berkshire Hathaway Inc become so big that it will find it hard to grow?   Many retail investors who converged on Omaha, Nebraska, for Berkshire's annual meeting on Saturday acknowledged that its fastest growth days are likely behind it. But they said Berkshire is still a good long-term bet as faith remains in Buffett and his management team's more than 4-decade-long record of stellar returns, and the company's tentacles into many sectors of the U.S. economy. ""Yes, it is a concern, but I have to get my expectations in line,"" said Julie Fehrnstrom, a mother of three from Orinda, California, attending her fifth meeting. ""They are not driven by short-term decision making and they have really smart management. You really don't always find that."" Sherrie Palmer, a social worker from Portage la Prairie, Manitoba, was attending her first Berkshire meeting, one of 35,000 or so investors. ""The steepness of the growth is leveling off, but it's not a concern,"" Palmer said. ""We like the manner in which decisions are made and I don't worry about this being an organization jumping to a fad that won't pan out."" Patience has served Berkshire shareholders well. Investing in companies with dependable businesses and sound management has helped Berkshire as an investment trounce major competitors since Buffett took it over in 1965. Berkshire is now one of the largest U.S. companies by market value, with more than 288,000 employees in dozens of businesses, covering everything from ice cream to underwear and insurance to railroads. But its massive size - currently around $268 billion in market value - has made it hard for Berkshire to grow as fast as it once did. While Berkshire performs well in down markets, it can lag in rising markets. Buffett reminded shareholders that 2009-2013 may prove to be the first five-year period ever when the company's growth in book value per share will lag the Standard & Poor's 500 index including dividends. ""People who buy stocks now and hold stocks for 20 years will make money,"" Buffett told Reuters Insider in an interview on Saturday evening. ""Those who hold for 20 days, I don't know what will happen."" M&A, SUCCESSION It has also become harder for the company to find deals that are large enough to move the needle. In February, Berkshire, along with Brazilian investment firm 3G Capital, struck a deal to buy ketchup maker H.J. Heinz Co, and Buffett said he was looking for more big acquisitions. But in an interview on Friday, Berkshire Vice Chairman Charlie Munger said high prices have made attractive deals scarce. ""With interest rates at zero, the prices being paid for businesses are very high,"" Berkshire's second-in-command said. Still, size has advantages. Berkshire's quarterly profit rose nearly 51 percent on solid performance in insurance and many of its other units. The results showed that its more than 80 businesses are benefiting from a strengthening economy, as illustrated by increased traffic on its Burlington Northern railroad unit, new customers for its McLane food distribution business and stepped-up demand for its Forest River recreational vehicles, to name just a few. ""In the 1990s, Warren was criticized for not being 'state of the art,'"" said Arthur Cohen, a financial adviser from Highland Park, Illinois, who was attending his 15th meeting. ""I'm not critical of his performance since."" Investors have also worried about what will happen to Berkshire after Buffett, 82, and Munger, 89, leave. In his most extensive comments to date about the future of Berkshire after he is gone, Buffett said he still expects the conglomerate to be a partner of choice for distressed companies. Buffett said he and his board are ""solidly in agreement"" on who should be the next chief executive - but offered no names - and said his son, Howard, would become chairman to ensure that Berkshire had the right CEO in place. ""The key is preserving a culture and having a successor, a CEO that will have more brains, more energy, more passion for it than even I have,"" Buffett said in response to a shareholder question at the meeting. BIG BASH As Berkshire has grown, so has the yearly extravaganza, now Omaha's second-biggest annual tourism event behind the College World Series baseball tournament. The event attracted many well-known investors, including Mario Gabelli, Leon Cooperman and Chris Davis, as well as mom-and-pop investors. Missy Krasso, a driver for Happy Cab in Omaha, makes as much as $3,000 in fares during the Berkshire weekend. Wall Street tips well, she said. Before the meeting began, Buffett roamed an exhibit hall at the arena featuring Berkshire-owned companies. Cherry Coke in hand, he dipped coconut bon-bons in a fondant coating at See's Candies, admired a model Burlington Northern railroad and tossed newspapers. Berkshire owns the Omaha World-Herald and others. A new addition to the series of events around the meeting this year was an ""Invest in Yourself"" five-kilometer run through downtown Omaha, with Buffett starting it off, if not necessarily setting the pace. The real mad sprint began at 6:30 a.m. on Saturday, when dozens of shareholders rushed for the best seats directly in front of Buffett and Munger on the arena floor, large enough to be suitable for a rock-star concert. Sherman Silber, a fertility doctor who has attended the meetings for 15 years, said he misses the ""old format"" where he could just go to the podium and ask a question. ""Now you have to do all this lottery stuff,"" he said. But Rosie Smith, a finance executive for a Baltimore book printer, said she keeps coming back for more. ""We came out here, and it was the wildest thing we've ever seen,"" she said, referring to the first of her 10 visits to the meeting. ""Every year, it keeps snowballing.""

The negotiated price of the deal is around $46 per share, said one of the people, who wished to remain anonymous because they are not permitted to speak to the media. That would mean the deal value would be more than $6.5 billion. Discussions are ongoing and the terms of the deal could still change, the sources said. Calls to BMC and Bain were not immediately returned. Golden Gate officials declined to comment. The deal would be one of the largest leveraged buyouts so far this year, after Michael Dell teamed up with private equity firm Silver Lake Partners LP to take Dell Inc private for $24.4 billion. Silver Lake accounts for only a quarter of the equity in that deal. Buoyant debt markets have encouraged private equity to consider larger deals, which in turn call for larger equity checks and make buyout firms more open to teaming up. Houston, Texas-based BMC Software shares ended trading at $45.42 on Friday. It competes with Oracle Corp, SAP AG, CA Inc and Compuware Corp, and has been under pressure from Paul Singer's activist hedge fund Elliott Associates LP to sell itself since last year. Elliott, a seasoned investor in the software sector, has a 9.7-percent stake in the company, and has argued that BMC's management was neglecting a huge opportunity to expand into Internet-based business software, a market dominated by the likes of Salesforce.com Inc. The world's largest providers of software for enterprises, including Oracle, SAP and Microsoft Corp, have already begun investing heavily in that market. Elliott is a shareholder in business software company Attachmate Corp, alongside Golden Gate, Thoma Bravo and Francisco Partners. BMC is due to announce first-quarter earnings on May 7. The company said on April 8 that it would reduce its workforce following a company-wide operational review. Those job cuts will result in pretax charges of approximately $33 million to $38 million for severance and related termination costs, it added.

USBRE9440B620130505,Europe's jobs crisis comes into sharper relief,dy Bruce,"Sun May 5, 2013 3:04pm EDT",http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/05/05/us-economy-global-weekahead-idUSBRE9440B620130505,"LONDON  (Reuters) - Europe's policymakers are starting to recognize chronic unemployment as a crisis in its own right, rather than something that will resolve itself when the economy improves.   Compared with the United States, where the labor market is a key determinant of economic policy, European authorities have been more passive in their approach to jobs for many years. But the depth of the jobless epidemic, especially in euro zone countries like Spain and Italy, means their rhetoric is at least changing. Friday's spring economic forecast from the European Commission was a case in point. Invoking European Central Bank President Mario Draghi's pledge to protect the euro, the European Union's Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn said the EU would do ""whatever it takes"" to overcome the jobless crisis. In previous forecasts, Rehn mentioned reducing unemployment mainly as something that would only come further down the line, after the completion of painful reforms. Jobs data from across the Atlantic, also released on Friday, contrasted starkly. The United States added 165,000 non-farm jobs in April, while the unemployment rate there fell to 7.6 percent, its lowest since December 2008. Business surveys on Monday will reveal more about the pace of job losses in the euro zone, where the jobless rate hit a new record 12.1 percent in March, meaning more than 19 million euro zone citizens are out of work. ""At some point they're going to have to change tack, and maybe 12.1 percent unemployment is the time,"" said David Blanchflower, economics professor at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire, and formerly a Bank of England policymaker. He noted ECB President Draghi did not mention the labor market at all in his economic analysis of the euro area last week, after cutting interest rates to a new record low of 0.5 percent. ""If you see the latest minutes from the (U.S. Federal Reserve), they really are targeting unemployment, as they should be. They really do take it seriously,"" he said. NO QUICK FIX Even if Europe's politicians increasingly recognize joblessness as a crisis that must be fought actively, little exists that could spur a quick change in fortunes. ""There are always measures which the authorities can take to get the labor market going,"" said Philip Shaw, chief economist at Investec in London. ""The problem is, given the depth of the crisis, they're unlikely to make a material, positive impact for quite some time. There is absolutely no quick fix to the problem."" Given how Europe has dragged on global economic growth for the last few years, officials there have had no shortage of advice from politicians around the world. U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew last month said a rush towards fiscal austerity in Europe had worsened the economic situation in some countries, arguing that there is a need to assess the impact of budget cuts on growth and employment. He and his G7 finance minister counterparts meet on Friday in London, and although the agenda focuses on fighting tax evasion, the event will provide another chance to discuss how Europe can return to prosperity. Ultimately, the solution lies in the structural reforms that are already slowly taking place, and also in the restoration of Europe's banking system. Shaw cited the fact U.S. banks recapitalized earlier than their European peers, particularly in the euro zone, as one of many reasons why the American economy has performed better, therefore creating more jobs. ""(U.S.) unemployment peaked in double digits back in 2009. Looking at a snapshot now, the U.S. seems to have less of an unemployment issue than continental Europe,"" said Shaw. ""However, that hides the fact it's been a long, hard grind getting the jobless rate down in the U.S."" And even a return to sustained economic growth might not be enough to guarantee European unemployment will fall significantly, said Blanchflower. He co-authored a study, released last week, showing how the statistics showing an apparently resilient jobs market failed to cover a sharp rise in the number of people working less than they would like. ""If any recovery comes, presumably it's going to come by the incumbent (employees) working more hours, which means the unemployment rate doesn't come down as fast as you'd have thought,"" said Blanchflower. ""So it looks like we're going to be stuck with high unemployment for a long time."" (Editing by  James Jukwey )"
USBRE9440BZ20130505,Gulf airlines prepare for Boeing's 777X offering,aveen Menon,"Sun May 5, 2013 4:14pm EDT",http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/05/05/us-emirates-airlines-777x-idUSBRE9440BZ20130505,"DUBAI  (Reuters) - As they prepare to buy Boeing's ( BA.N ) new 777X jet, Gulf airline giants Emirates EMIRA.UL and Qatar Airways are warning that Boeing must avoid the mistakes of the 787 Dreamliner, which cost customers millions of dollars when its batteries failed.   These fast-growing Gulf carriers are expected to be among the first and possibly biggest customers for Boeing's latest offering, which was presented to customers last week. ""For sure they have changed, I hope they have,"" Emirates' President Tim Clark said, when asked whether the Dreamliner crisis has changed Boeing's approach and thinking. ""Boeing came out of the ashes of the Sonic Cruiser years ago and came up with the Dreamliner, which was a leap of faith by any stretch. They were just beginning to stabilize when things went wrong again,"" said Clark. Emirates is not a customer of the Dreamliner but is the largest 777 operator with up to 175 jets that will need replacing soon. Boeing announced it had begun selling an upgraded aircraft family code-named 777X, launching a race against Airbus for sales of long-haul jets. Boeing, which has just emerged from the Dreamliner crisis, will now have to convince customers who have lost millions due to the grounding of the 787s. Qatar Airways, which grounded all its five Dreamliner aircraft, would receive compensation from Boeing, its chief executive Akbar al Baker said. ""Everyone takes risks but Boeing took a very big risk because they went from ground zero to 100 in one leap instead of going in stages,"" Qatar Airways' outspoken chief Baker told Reuters on board its first 787 flight from Dubai to Doha last week, after the battery fix was installed. Apart from Qatar Airways, fast-growing Gulf airline Etihad Airways has 41 Dreamliners on order. ""We put together a permanent and comprehensive fix for the issue and we are confident of the 787 safety,"" Boeing's Middle East President Jeff Johnson said when asked about assurances to its Gulf customers. LESSONS LEARNED U.S. regulators formally lifted flight restrictions on the 787 last month and allowed the redesigned lithium-ion battery system to be installed in airlines. Ethiopian Airlines became the first carrier last month to resume flying the revamped Dreamliner followed by All Nippon Airways ( 9202.T ) and Qatar Airways. Eight airlines currently own Dreamliners including United Airlines ( UAL.N ), ANA, JAL, Air India Ltd AIN.UL, LATAM Airlines Group LAN.SN and LOT Polish Airlines LOT.UL. Under questioning from aviation authorities last month, Boeing said it would more rigorously challenge its test assumptions in the future, and that its analysis of the problem could change as more facts become known. ""Things will not be so easy for them in the U.S. now. Boeing has to learn from that too as a lot of the 787 was self-certified,"" said Emirates' Clark. Clark said the plane maker has a lot to learn from the Dreamliner crisis. ""Perhaps Boeing was not quite ready for it all (the 787). But the crisis helped them learn a lot about design, metallurgy."" The U.S. company may also rethink its overseas manufacturing. ""They placed their faith in supplies from overseas manufacturers and expected them to be as good as they wanted. That is something they will be less inclined to do now,"" said Clark. The industry is learning from the Dreamliner experience and is also pushing harder on areas such as aircraft propulsion, engine technology, batteries and others. ""Like in every new product there will be continuous improvement,"" said Baker. ""Boeing has a permanent solution now but as new processes are developed, so will new batteries. It may not be the lithium-ion batteries later, it may be something else. I'm sure Boeing will look for improvements in the batteries."" 777X BUYS Boeing is now offering a new 400-seat version of the 777, known as 777-9X, and also a 777-8X which would have the longest range of more than 9,300 nautical miles, people briefed about the talks said on Friday. Both Emirates and Qatar Airways have spoken to Boeing about these offerings. Presentations were made to the management of both carriers. Baker has said that he is very keen on the 8X and 9X versions of the plane while Emirates' Clark has said specifications of the new plane suits its requirements. Clark has hinted at plans to replace its fleet of 175 Boeing 777s with the 777X. However, despite the interest, airlines are also concerned whether the problems with the Dreamliner may result in Boeing's other programs being pushed back. ""The cash outflow must be quite difficult to manage,"" said Clark. ""The cash exposure is a tricky one and they are also trying to get the other programs out of the door."" ""An aircraft that they thought could cost $6 to $10 billion is now more than $20 billion."" The halt to Dreamliner flights has cost Boeing an estimated $600 million and forced it to halt deliveries.

USBRE9440DS20130505,"Analysis: Despite U.S. oil boom, some states fear fuel scarcity",sten Hays and  Sabina Zawadzki,"Sun May 5, 2013 5:58pm EDT",http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/05/05/us-enterprise-pipeline-shutdown-idUSBRE9440DS20130505,"HOUSTON/NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The U.S. oil and gas renaissance that has bestowed unexpected prosperity on states from North Dakota to Pennsylvania and boosted distillate production to a record high in the Midwest is also causing pockets of fuel scarcity: just ask Arkansas.   Farmers, truckers and politicians there are up in arms over plans by Enterprise Product Partners ( EPD.N ) to end deliveries on a key pipeline that ships diesel and jet fuel from Texas on July 1. Instead, Enterprise plans to reverse the line to ship ethane, chiefly used as a petrochemical feedstock, from the shale fields in Ohio and Pennsylvania to the Gulf Coast. The Arkansas attorney general has appealed to federal regulators to intervene, local merchants warn of a ""catastrophe,"" truckers fear a jump in prices and even a U.S. Air Force base is stocking up on extra fuel. The controversy is the latest sign of how energy and infrastructure companies are rushing to adapt to the production boom that no one predicted five years ago. And while the eventual result should be a more modern, efficient U.S. fuel network, the changes are forcing some parts of the country to redraw decades-old supply lines. ""When you cut off supply, it's not as if there's a lot of extra supply just waiting to be used,"" said Ron Leone, executive vice president of the Missouri Petroleum Marketers and Convenience Store Association. ""You're going to have to scramble to make it up, and in that scramble there will be outages and shortages,"" he said. Enterprise, which announced its plans for the so-called TE Products line in March, says demand for interstate shipments on the 230,000 barrels per day line has fallen sharply in recent years, and that it is not ""commercially feasible"" to invest an estimated $50 million to upgrade a parallel line. Enterprise declined to say how much the pipeline was delivering on a daily basis now. Local fuel groups argue it is an energy lifeline and that closing it will roil the local market, raising prices as fuel is fetched from further afield and sparking shortages when demand normally met by the pipeline shifts to other sources. Arkansas, a state of 3 million people north of Louisiana and best known as the home of former President Bill Clinton, is not the first to see a darker side of the shale energy bonanza. Northeast states have also fretted over fuel supplies following the closure of several refineries, partly because they could not compete with inland rivals running cheap shale crude. The reversal would have a ""significant, damaging effect"" on business, the Arkansas Attorney General's office said in an April 25 filing to the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), asking for Enterprise's plan to be rejected or at least suspended for seven months for an investigation to take place. Enterprise declined comment on the filing. 'OUTAGES AND SHORTAGES' The TE Products line runs 806 miles from Texas via Arkansas to southeast parts of Missouri, Illinois, Indiana and Ohio. Under the company's $1.5 billion Appalachia-to-Texas, or ATEX, project, it would reverse the pipeline and build an extension into Ohio and Pennsylvania to pump ethane gas, often produced alongside natural gas from shale reserves from the northern Utica and Marcellus plays, south to petrochemical producers on the Gulf Coast. The plan emerges at a time when overall fuel supplies in the broader Midwest area are healthier than ever, with refiners running flat-out as a glut of discounted Canada and North Dakota crude pumps up profit margins, while demand is dimmed. Distillate production in the PADD 2 region from Oklahoma to Michigan is at a record high, up almost 9 percent since 2007, while demand has fallen by 8.6 percent during the same span, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. But regional traders say that broad trend is irrelevant for a narrow corridor including Arkansas, about a third of Missouri, up to a third of Illinois and parts of southern Indiana and Ohio that rely on the TE Products line. ""I think it borders on being catastrophic,"" said William Fleischli, executive vice president of the Illinois Petroleum Marketers Association. Tom Gabe, president and chief executive of Heritage Petroleum, an Indiana-based fuel distributor and shipper on the line, explained how customers on the TE Products line in North City, south Illinois, might now have to go 100 miles south to a different terminal Cape Girardeau, Missouri, to get fuel. If demand for fuel from that other terminal suddenly doubles to 3,000 truckloads a week, local prices will have to adjust. ""The end user is going to pay more for his fuel,"" he said. Other alternatives include the Explorer Pipeline, from southeast Texas through Oklahoma and central Missouri up to northeast Illinois, or the Explorer line through Illinois, to then be loaded into Buckeye Partners' ( BPL.N ) system to move east. But if the endpoint is Missouri or Arkansas, ""you're driving the barrel,"" a Midwest oil products trader said, meaning trucking it from a source other than the TE Products line, adding freight costs. The Association of Oil Pipelines says trucking products for 300 miles could cost 20 to 30 cents a barrel compared with 4 cents for a barrel shipped on a pipeline. AIR FORCE ANGST ""Driving the barrel"" is what the Little Rock Air Force Base and airlines at the Clinton Airport in Little Rock will have to do because no other major pipelines shipping jet fuel or distillates run through the center of Arkansas, traders say. The one petroleum refinery in Arkansas, Delek US Holdings' ( DK.N ) 83,000 bpd plant in El Dorado, could make commercial jet fuel, but that would only reduce diesel output - emptying one cup to fill another, said Steve Ferren, executive vice president of the Arkansas Oil Marketers Association. Delek declined comment on how the closure may affect its production. The Air Force base in Little Rock will be topping up its fuel tanks to add an inventory buffer while it looks into alternative supply sources, says Mimi Schirmacher, a spokeswoman for Defense Logistics Agency-Energy, which sources energy for U.S. military forces. SHUTTING DOWN The 16-inch (40-cm) TE Products distillate pipeline runs alongside a 20-inch line that moves gasoline and natural gas liquids along the same route. The larger line could be reworked to allow it to transport distillate fuel as well, including the installation of more pumps, but the investment is not warranted, Enterprise says. ""Every terminal and destination that is currently served by this pipeline, has and will continue to have other alternatives - including terminals served by other pipelines, terms attached directly to refineries, or terms served by barge,"" says Enterprise spokesman Rick Rainey. Adding to the concerns of traders, Enterprise is considering similar options for the 210,000 bpd Centennial line, which ships gasoline and distillates 795-mile from Texas to Chicago. The Centennial is a 50/50 joint venture with Marathon Petroleum Corp ( MPC.N ). The 24- and 26-inch line runs north along the Mississippi River on the eastern border of Arkansas and southeast corner of Missouri, then to Bourbon, Illinois, south of Chicago. Tom Zulim, Enterprise's senior vice president of regulated businesses and refined products, said last month the company considered moving different products or reversing the line but ""nothing has really come to fruition"" yet.
